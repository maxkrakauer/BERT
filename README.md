# AlephBERT Production for sentence completion

## setup:
If you are using a unix-based machine (aka a mac or a machine with a linux OS),
you dont need to clone anything by yourself! Just run `./setup.sh`.
Note that if you don't download the tune file, you won't be able to use the wiki hebrew-tuned version, only the original model. if you try to use the tuned model without completing the next step, the server will terminate.
### FineTune version setup:
If you want to use the wiki hebrew tuned version, please contact the authors to get access to **tune_6_10.pkl**; store it in the same dir with "setup.sh" and run `./setup.sh`. The rest will be taken care of by the software.
## setup from source (all users including windows users):
1. `git clone -b production https://github.com/maxkrakauer/BERT.git`
2. `cd BERT`
3. `mkdir AlephBERT-main/models/myFirstTune`
4. (optional) store tune_6_10.pkl in AlephBERT-main/models/myFirstTune
5. `cd ui/client`
6. `npm install`
7. `npm start`
8. open "http://localhost:8080"
### note:
If you havn't completed step number 4, you can only use original the model.

If you have already completed the setup but the server port was closed, open terminal at BERT/ui/client
and enter `npm start`.
